# Image-Captioning
One of my hobby projects. I was amazed by the effectiveness of RNN's and decided to try out for myself.
I decided to do the Image Captioning project as it would be fun to see how my code predicts the captions to images, and also I would get a hands-on experience with RNNs and LSTMs. It was also exciting because it combines both CNNs and RNNs together.

I've used PyTorch and for image feature extraction used AlexNet from torchvision models and trained the last fully connected layers for embedding.

Note: You need to run the "train.py" file
I've not uploaded the trained checkpoint files because they were too large to be uploaded!
